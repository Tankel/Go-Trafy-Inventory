# Go-Trafy-Inventory
Go-Trafy-Inventory is an inventory management system app created for a local convenience store named "GO Trafy". The project is built using Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL for the database.

## Project Status
This project is currently unfinished and is still in development. I'm actively working on improving the functionality and features of the app.

## Future Development
Our goal is to develop this app into a complete Point of Sale (POS) system for Go-Trafy. We plan to add more features such as sales tracking, customer management, and reporting.

## Main Interface
Below is a screenshot of the main interface of Go-Trafy-Inventory.
